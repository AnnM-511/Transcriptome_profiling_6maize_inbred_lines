# Response of Zea mays transcriptome to maize lethal necrosis (MLN) 
## SUMMARY
Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) threatens Sub-Saharan Africa's food security, with few commercial inbred lines showing tolerance. This study analyzes four lines with varying MLN resistance levels. Transcriptomic analysis revealed gene expression patterns responding to MLN-causing viruses, highlighting innate immunity components like R genes and virus resistance pathways, including RNAi and ubiquitin-proteasome systems. Expression differential of translation initiation factors, eIF4E and eIF4G, was notable, with some showing phenotypic correlation. This experiment offers new prospects for breeding or engineering MLN-resistant maize germplasm.
## ABSTRACT
Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is a significant threat to food security in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with limited commercial inbred lines displaying tolerance. This study analyzed the transcriptomes of four commercially used maize inbred lines and a non-adapted inbred line, all with varying response levels to MLN. RNA-Seq revealed differentially expressed genes in response to infection by maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), the causative agents of MLN. Key findings included the identification of components of the plant innate immune system, such as differentially regulated R genes (mainly LRRs), and activation/deactivation of virus resistance pathways, including RNA interference (RNAi) via Argonaute (AGO), Dicer-like proteins, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) via RING/U-box and ubiquitin ligases. Genes associated with redox signaling, WRKY transcription factors, and cell modification were also differentially expressed. Additionally, the expression of translation initiation and elongation factors, eIF4E and eIF4G, correlated with the presence of MLN viruses. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of MLN resistance and highlight potential gene candidates for engineering or selecting MLN-resistant maize germplasm for SSA.
